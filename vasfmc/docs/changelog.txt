     http://www.vas-project.org
=============================================================================


V2.0a9 - 19.04.2009
-------------------
* X-Plane 9.x fully supported on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows
* Added support for Linux 32/64 and Mac OS X
* Fixed some issues which could lead to crashes.
* Added B-style ECAM/EICAS
* Fixed ECAM TOGA N1 value display.
* Added Level-D terminal procedure support. (Note: Navigraph has now added the
    LEVEL-D procedures to the vasFMC AIRAC.)
* Added "Heading to Altitude" waypoint support.
* Removed turn circle display for A-style and made small changes to B-style.
* Added Fly By Wire functionality derived from easyFBW (see MCDU MENU)
    Note: The FBW is tuned for the Project Airbus A318 and A320 and may not work
    correctly with other models.
    Note2: The FBW will have problems when the frames drop a certain limit, the
    more frames per second you have, the better the FBW will behave.
* Fixed many many minor issues and made many small changes and additions.
* Added support for FCU TRK/FPA mode.
* Implemented proper A-style flaps handling for "1", "1+F" and "2" according to
    airspeed.
* Added pushback functionality to MCDU (see MENU -> PUSHBACK).
* Added callouts for outermarker, 10000ft and A-style flaps 1, 2 and 3.
* Added left/right PFD, ND and MCDU support to standalone version, note the
    additional FSUIPC offsets.
    Note: You will need a fast PC to display both left- and right-hand display.
    Note2: You can switch between the FCU "left only" and "full" mode via the
    MCDU MENU->SETTINGS page.
* Added TERR button to FCU for geo data (coastlines) and removed the setting
    from the MCDU SETTINGS MENU.
* Moved items from the context menus to the MCDU MENU pages.
* Added FONT page to MCDU MENU->SETTINGS, the font sizes can now be controlled
    there.
* Added customizable aircraft config files which can be loaded via the
    MCDU MENU-> FMGC page.
    Note: The aircraft configs are located in the "aircraft_data" subdirectory.
* Added direct support for CPFlight MCP with configurable commands (see MCDU
    MENU->INTERFACES and cpflight.txt).
* Added lots of new vasFMC FSUIPC offsets, please note that some offsets have
    changed!
* Implemented flight level change autopilot mode with speed command (alias OP
    CLB).
* Implemented FD takeoff mode (SRS), when switching on the flightdirector on
    ground, the takeoff mode is armed. Note: When the takeoff mode is armed,
    pressing HDG or NAV arms the lateral mode to  be used above the
    acceleration altitude.
* Added inital and maximum climb thrust to be entered on the MCDU PERF page.
    Note: The climb thrust will reach the maximum value at 30000ft.
* Made some performance enhancements regarding the route calculations
    (projection, etc.)
* Added opencockpits.com compatible IOCP Server which enables vasFMC to receive
    commands from IOCP clients (see MCDU MENU->INTERFACES and iocp.txt).
* Added FMOD lib (http://www.fmod.org) for the FMC sounds. The sound output
    problems should be history now.
    FMOD Sound System, copyright © Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd., 1994-2007.
* Added vasFMC connection mode (single, master and slave), see MCDU
    MENU->INTERFACES page. A vasFMC instance set to slave mode can be connected
    to another vasFMC instance set to master mode.
* Did a massive code cleanup and implemented refresh load balancing to stabalize
    framerates.
* Removed the context menus and moved setup functions to MCDU MENU pages
    DISPLAY 1 & 2.
* Added TCAS standby mode, the modes now are: OFF, STANDBY, ON
* Enhanced flight director and speed trend smoothing.
* Added basic takeoff and landing checklists to A-style ECAM.
* The TOD (top of descent) calculation now takes the next waypoint with a "at"
    or "at or below" altitude restriction into account.
* Move distance to TOD display to CRZ PERF page.
* After takeoff, the flight director will now change to "RWY TRK" mode, which
    aims to keep the aircraft's track aligned with the runway.
* Added Airbus throttle mode which is disabled by default and can be enabled on
    the MCDU MENU -> SETTING page. (The vasFMC thrust mode is mandatory.)
    When enabled, the joystick thrust lever will behave like a real airbus with
    CL, FLX/MCT and TOGA detents. The joystick throttle lever will always
    directly command the requested N1, even if the A/THR is off.
* Added more checks when inserting SIDs, STARs, etc. to avoid unwanted double
    routings.
* Added click sounds and callouts for Airbus throttle lever detents and thrust
    modes.
* Added basic A-style approach phase to the MCDU PERF pages. For now only the
    ILS will be tuned if the arrival runway has an ILS and the speed will be set
    to green dot speed.
* Added A-style "LAND", "FLARE" and "ROLLOUT" and "LOC/GS capture" FMA modes.
* Implemented "heading to intercept" waypoint support.

* Changed CDU font to Lucida Sans Typewriter.
* The INIT B page is now only accessible when on ground and engines not running.
* The INIT A page is now only accessible in PREFLIGHT and TAXI flight phases.
* Inflight the GW and FOB values can now be seen on the new rudimentary FUEL
    PREF page.
* Changed lots of autopilot and autothrust details.
* Added separate acceleration and thrust reduction altitudes now on the PERF
    TAKEOFF page.
* Added transition level to PERF APPROACH page. The altimeter setting will blink
    when descending below the TL with altimeter set to STD.
* Added flaps/trim setting to PERF TAKEOFF page.  When entering a trim value,
    the trim will be set to the aircraft when on ground.
* When in PRE FLIGHT or TAXIING flight phase, the autopilot modes (announced by
    the FMA) will be empty. When the flight phase changes to TAKEOFF, the
    autopilot modes will be set automatically, if the flight director was turned
    on before.
* The NAV mode now engages when passing 30ft radar altitude on departure.
* The AP can now be engaged at 100ft radar altitude on departure.
* A flightplan can now only be loaded (from file, VROUTE or via ICAO route
    entry) in PREFLIGHT and TAXI flight phases.
* Made A-style flaps handling (e.g. automatic retraction from 1+F to 1 at
    210kts)  optional via the MCDU MENU -> SETTINGS page.
* Fixed thrust reduction / acceleration altitudes to really be altitude rather
    than height values. Both altitude values will be set to 1000ft above field
    level whenever the departure airport changes.
* Added first version of new MCDU graphic by Ricardo Carvalho.
* The thrust reduction/acceleration altitudes will now be automatically set to
    current altitude + 1000 when on ground and the thr red/acc altitudes are
    lower than 500ft.
* The TOD callout will now only be done when currently on cruise FL.
* Added separate throttle lever mode to MCDU MENU -> SETTINGS. Enable this if
    you have separate throttle joystick inputs.
* Altitude restriction must now always be specified in feet, not FL.
* Fixed bug causing crashes with some planes when flaps set to full in A-style.
* Added FCU left mouse button input areas for NAV mode/range for die-hard Mac
    users.
* Added 100ft/1000ft altitude set mode to FCU + new clickspots.
* Added status values which are written to FSUIPC offsets for home cockpit
    builders.  See fsuipc.offsets.txt (scroll to the bottom of the file) for
    details.
* Added "seat belt" and "no smoking" announcements to ECAM for FS-X.
* Reorganized MCDU -> MENU -> SETTING -> DISPLAY 1/2 pages.
* Added direct on/off setter FSUIPC offsets for AIRPORT, VOR, NDB, GEO,
    CONSTRAINT display. See fsuipc.offsets.txt for details.
* The missed approach route will now only be displayed when at least one
    waypoint of the missed approach route is visible on the F-PLAN page.
* Disabled PLAN mode for the right side MCDU/FCU, this will be fixed in the
    future.
* The VROUTE AIRAC restriction flag setting is now saved to the config.
* Added new default AIRAC 0609 including transitions. Many thanks to the
    navigraph team for their great support!
* Added fully configurable checklists (text + voice), the checklist to be loaded
    is specified in the aircraft configuration.
    The checklists can be found under MCDU MENU -> CHECKLIST.
* Added sound channels to the FMC processed sounds, the current channels are:
    COMPUTER, MECHANICAL, OTHER PILOT. Whether to use sound channels or 
    not can be set on the MCDE MENU -> SETTINGS page.
    When enabled, sounds from different channels can be played simultaneously,
    for example a co-pilot flap callout together whith a computer generated
    radar altitude callout.
* Added IDENT button to MCDU MENU -> SQUAWKBOX page.
* Changed key assignments, please take a look at the keys helpfile.
