During the long and daunting nights in the code camps the following countries
unknowingly supported the development of vasFMC:
    France - Cheese
    Chile - Red wine
    Scotland - Whisky
    Germany - Liquid fruit, aka Schnaps

While travelling between the development dungeons, the city council of
Wiesbaden was generously donated EUR 15.00.

No animal was harmed during the making of this software.

Alex also wants to thank the .977 alternative channel crew for their 
*great* music which accompanied me throught hours and hours of coding! :)
