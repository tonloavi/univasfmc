	  SID/STAR MAKER FOR VAS FMC
====================================================
		       v1.0a


   ============
1) Introduction
   ============
   
   This is a very easy tool to convert the FSNavigator Terminal Procedures 
   (SID/STAR) into the vasFMC format. NOW you can use this very cool program
   with approximately 1000 terminal procedures. You can also modify or create
   new procedures!
   
   ATTENTION!
   
   The output file is very similar to the Flight1 ATR72-500 format but this is not
   contain some parameters which are needed to ATR72 FMC! The converted files are
   useless with ATR72.

   >>> You can use this program AT YOUR OWN RISK!
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   ============
2) Requirements
   ============

   SSMaker uses the Visual Basic 6 Runtime Environment. You have to download 
   this library from "http://www.5star-shareware.com/Windows/Utilities/Libraries/vb6.html"
   If any other *.DLL or *.OCX files are missing download them from the internet, use
   Google :) All of them are free. If you downloaded a file, copy it to "...\windows\system32"
   folder. After that click: START>Run and type:  regsvr32 filename.ocx or regsvr32 filename.dll
   Of course the file name is the name of your file! This will register the file for
   Windows.

   SSMaker uses the FSNavigator program as the sources of SID/STAR files.
   You need for FSNavigator to download the SID/STAR files from their server. You can
   download the trial version from "www.fsnavigator.com" but you don't need for FSNavigator
   to create your own terminal procedures.                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   =====
3) USAGE
   =====

   Copy SSMaker.exe to your "..\vasFMC\navdata" directory.
   Copy all FSNavigator SID/STAR files from "..\Flight Simulator 9\Modules\FSNavigator\SidStar"
   folder to the same folder with SSMaker.exe (to the vasFMC\navdata directory). DO NOT
   PUT THEM TO THE "SID" AND "STAR" FOLDER INSIDE THE "..\vasFMC\navdata" DIRECTORY!

   Converter
   ~~~~~~~~~

   With the converter mode you can create vasFMC SID and STAR files from the FSNavigator files and
   the program automatically put them to the "..\vasfmc\navdata\sid" and "..\vasfmc\navdata\star" folder.

   Now you are ready to use your new procedures!

   A little help with directory structure:
 
   - Program Files
   	- vasFmc
		- cfg
		- docs
		- icon
		- navdata   / (You have to copy here the SSMaker.exe and the FSNavigator SIDs/STARs)
			- sid   / (The converter automatically copies here the converted files)
			- star   / (The converter automatically copies here the converted files)

   Create or Modify New Terminal Procedures

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   					        !!!! WARNING !!!
 				        	----------------
           >>>All changes are IMMIDIATELY take effect and they are ONLY undo by manual edit!<<<
      (for example if you change the name of a SID this will immidiately apply in the original file)
             I SUGGEST TO YOU MAKE A BACKUP FROM ALL TERMINAL PROCEDURE FILE BEFORE EDITING
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are five list in the main window:

	1: List of the airports
	2: List of the aviable SIDs of the selected airport
	3: List of the aviable STARs of the selected airport
        4: The legs of the selected SID or STAR
	5: Waypoint finder (uses installed AIRAC database)

   !Modify

   To modify any data select a SID for example and use the right mouse button to show
   the aviable options. You can apply this to modify any data in any field.

   !Create

   To create an absolute new airport with new procedures use the right mouse button in the Airport list.


   QUESTIONS
   =========

   # Where can i get waypoint coordinates?
        
	1: There is an integrated waypoint finder in the SSMaker which help you
	   to find the correct coordinates of a waypoint and make the procedure creation
	   easier. This uses the installed AIRAC database WAYPOINTS file (waypoints.txt and navaids.txt).
	
	2: You can calculate Place/Bearing/Distance waypoints. Use right click in the Waypoint Finder List
	   when you selected an item.	

	3: Some of the airport charts contain the waypoint coordinates.
        
	4: You can download the PMDG or PSS or any other Terminal Procedure files
	   from "www.navdata.at" for free and if you open these files with NOTEPAD
	   or WORDPAD you can catch the waypoint coordinates you want.

	VasFMC only supports the WAYPOINT TO WAYPOINT Terminal procedures. It can't fly
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	inbound or outbound radial to/from a FIX, etc.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   # Why didn't you make a 'PMDG to vasFMC' or 'PSS to vasFMC' SID/STAR converter? They
     contain more and more up to date terminal procedures.

     They uses very complicated SID/STAR format (in practice an own "script languge").
     FSNavigator uses a very simple format. The only problem that some of SIDs and STARs are
     out of date. This was the reason wherefore i made the SID/STAR maker not just the
     converter.


   !EXAMPLE!
   =========

   This is a small example tutorial how can you add SIMEG 5 ALFA Departure route to Copenhagen
   Airport.
   
   - Open the SSMaker and select "Create Terminal Procedures to vasFMC"
   - Type "EKCH" in Quick Search textbox above the airports list.
   - Click with the Right Mouse Button in the SIDs LIST and select "Add new SID" option.
   - Enter "SIMEG5A" to the name field. (I used the airport SID Charts to get the name)
   - Enter "04L" to the Runway field. (I used the airport SID Charts to get the correct runway)
   - Click on the "OK" button. Now the program takes "SIMEG5A" to the bottom of the SIDs list.
   - Find it and click on it. As you can see the LEGS list is empty. Lets add the waypoints.
   - You have different choices to get the waypoint coordinates (see above).
   - Now see the EKCH SID RNAV SID chart for runway 04L. Can be downloaded from:
     "http://www.slv.dk/Dokumenter/dscgi/ds.py/View/Collection-344"
   - As you can see the first waypoint for SIMEG5A is "CH361". Type "CH361" to the WAYPOINT FINDER
     Search Box in the SSMaker and press ENTER. Wait for the results.
   - If everything went ok, you can see "CH361|5574540|12854440|" in the results list. Now
     double click on it. Now it is added to the LEGS list.
   - Find the second waypoint (CH362 - see the CHARTS) enter to the Waypoint finder etc...
   - If you are ready just exit.
