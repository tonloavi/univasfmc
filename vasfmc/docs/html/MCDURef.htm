<p>The MCDU window is where all flight planning and flight route
interaction takes place. Information is arranged on several
pages/screens which are selected by pressing one of the Page Keys. Data
you enter is stored in one of the data fields on the active MCDU page
by clicking a Line Select Key (LSK). You can enter data from either
your computer keyboard or by clicking on the MCDU alphanumeric keys.
Use the Backspace key on your keyboard or the CLR key on the MCDU to
correct errors. Use lowercase letters only.</p>








    
<p class="warning">vasFMC is a work in progress, and as such not all of the functionality implied by the Page keys is implemented at this time.</p>

<h1><a name="MCDUDIR" id="MCDUDIR"></a>DIR Page</h1>








    
<p>This page allows you to go directly to a waypoint which is already
present in your flight plan, or to a waypoint you enter by hand. When
pressing DIR TO INSERT the lateral navigation mode changes to NAV, this
making your input effective immediatly.</p>








    
<p><img style="width: 361px; height: 236px;" src="MCDUDIRPage.jpg" alt="DIR Page" /></p>








    
<p>To go directly to an existing waypoint, scroll the waypoint list
with the mouse wheel or arrow keys on the MCDU and press the LSK for
the desired waypoint. To go to a waypoint not in the list, enter its
name and press the LSK next to <em>WAYPOINT[ ]</em>. The FMC sets the course when you press the <em>INSERT</em> LSK. You can scroll the list, select another waypoint or press the <em>ERASE</em> LSK at any time before <em>INSERT</em>.</p>








    
<p>Note that if you go directly to a waypoint and skip some in the
process (e.g. ATC has given you a "direct to" instruction), you will
not be able to go back to the skipped waypoints. The flight plan prior
to the selected waypoint is erased.</p>








    
<p>The FMC will insert your&nbsp;present position as a waypoint named T-P.</p>








    
<p><a href="#MCDUHome">Back to the top</a></p>








    
<h1><a name="MCDUPROG" id="MCDUPROG"></a>PROG Page</h1>








    
<p>The Progress page is primarily used to enter a new cruising FL or to
show the direct bearing/distance to an entered waypoint (right LSK 4).</p>








    
<p><img style="width: 363px; height: 239px;" src="MCDUPROGPage.jpg" alt="PROG Page" /></p>








    
<h2>Cruise Flightlevel</h2>








    
<p class="warning">vasFMC does not yet support VNAV (vertical
navigation). That is, it will not climb or descend the aircraft for
you. You can change the cruising flight level by entering a new value
and clicking the <em>CRZ</em> LSK, however this will not change the autopilot's altitude setting.</p>







<h2>Distance Information</h2>








    
<p>You can get the direction and distance to any intersection or navaid
in the navigation database, whether or not it is in your flight plan.</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Enter the name of the waypoint.</li>








      <li>Click the <em>TO [ ]</em> LSK. The bearing and distance to the entered waypoint will be updated continuously.</li>








    
</ul>







<br />







You may also enter runways here, e.g. LOWW34 - this will show you the distance to the runway's threshold.
    
<p><a href="#MCDUHome">Back to the top</a></p>








    
<h1><a name="MCDUPERF" id="MCDUPERF"></a>PERF Page</h1>








    
<p>The PERF page helps you automate throttle settings for different
phases of your flight, from takeoff to approach. Ideally, after setting
the throttle parameters here you should be able to press the <a href="MFCURef.htm#FCUAT">N1 AT button</a>
and not have to change the throttle settings until you are on final
approach. Please note that at speeds entered on the PERF pages will
only be taken into account automatically, if they are entered before the respective flight phase.</p>








    
<p>You can scroll between the different pages with the <em>NEXT PHASE</em> and <em>PREV PHASE</em> LSKs. If you are airborne, the <em>PREV PHASE</em> LSK will be replaced by an APPR PHASE<em></em> LSK, which when pressed (twice) will activate the approach phase (tune the ILS, set the speed to green dot speed).</p>








    
<p class="warning">The autothrottle (AT) automation works fairly well
for high quality simulations and the default MSFS turbojets. However,
the quality of free and payware aircraft varies greatly and you will
likely find it necessary to switch between N1 hold and speed/mach hold
in some aircraft during the various phases of flight.</p>








    
<h2>Takeoff</h2>








    
<p>A thorough discussion of V-speeds is beyond the scope of this
manual. MSFS has good information on these values in its ATP lessons,
and there is plenty of reference material available on the web.</p>








    
<p><img style="width: 364px; height: 237px;" src="MCDUPerf1.jpg" alt="PERF Takeoff" /></p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Enter the V1 speed and press the <em>V1</em> LSK. Continue entering the <em>VR</em> and <em>V2</em> speeds in the same way.  The V-speed settings are marked on the PFD and result in audio callouts.</li>








      <li>Enter the transition altitude in feet and press the <em>TRANS ALT</em> LSK. Above this altitude the A style PFD will blink the altimeter as a reminder to set STD pressure (see the <a href="MFCURef.htm#FCUAltimeter">FCU altimeter section</a>).</li>








      <li>Enter the altitude (above sea level, in feet) at which the
AT thrust should be reduced from takeoff N1 power to climb N1 power
(set on the Climb screen, see below) and the altitude at which the
aircraft should start to accelerate to the climb speed (set on the
Climb screen, see below), and press the <em>THR RED/ACC</em> LSK. E.g.
enter 1500/1500 if you want the aircraft to reduce the thrust and to
accelerate at 1500ft above sea level. Note: These altitude values will
be reset automatically to 1000ft above field elevation whenever the
departure airport is changed.</li>






  <li>Enter the flaps and elevator trim setting to be used for takeoff, e.g. 1/-0.4</li>








      <li>Enter the takeoff N1 percentage and press the <em>FLEX TAKEOFF N1</em> LSK.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Climb</h2>








    
<p>Once you have reached the <em>THR&nbsp;ACC</em> altitude (set on the Takeoff screen above), the AT enters the climb phase.</p>








    
<p><img style="width: 364px; height: 242px;" src="MCDUPerf2.jpg" alt="PERF Climb" /></p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Enter the  N1 percentages to be used for climbing to the cruise altitude and press the <em>INITIAL CLIMB N1</em> and<em> MAXIMUM CLIMB N1 </em>LSK. The climb thrust will reach the maximum value at an altitude of 30000 ft.</li>








      <li>Enter the speed value for climbing which the aircraft
should accelerate to after reaching the acceleration altitude (which is
entered in the <span style="font-style: italic;">TAKE OFF</span> screen).</li>







  <li>Enter the mach value for climbing and press the <em>PRESEL MACH</em>
LSK. When the aircraft's speed reaches this value, the AT will switch
to mach hold mode and the mach value will be set to this value.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<p class="warning">Note that the AT will remain in N1 hold mode regardless of the <em>PRESEL SPD</em> or <em>PRESEL MACH</em>. That is, the throttle will remain at the climb N1 % regardless of the speed setting. You can <a href="MFCURef.htm#FCUAT">switch between speed/mach hold and N1 hold  through the FCU</a>.</p>








    
<h2>Cruise</h2>








    
<p>Once you have reached your cruise altitude (set on the INIT or PROG pages), the AT enters the cruise phase.</p>








    
<p><img style="width: 362px; height: 240px;" src="MCDUPerf3.jpg" alt="PERF Cruise" /></p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Enter the cruising mach value and press the <em>PRESEL MACH</em> LSK. When you are about within 500 feet of the cruise altitude the AT will switch from N1 hold to mach hold automatically.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Descent</h2>








    
<p>Once you have started to descent&nbsp;from your cruise altitude, the AT enters the descent phase.</p>








    
<p><img style="width: 362px; height: 240px;" src="MCDUPerf4.jpg" alt="PERF Descent" /></p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Enter the desired descent speed and/or mach value and press the <em>PRESEL SPD</em> or <em>PRESEL MACH</em> LSK as appropriate.</li>








      <li>When the IAS reaches the <em>PRESEL SPD</em> during the descent, the AT will automatically switch from mach hold to speed hold.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Approach</h2>








    
When the approach phase is activated, the values on the approach page are in affect.<br />








    
<p><img style="width: 364px; height: 247px;" src="MCDUPerf5.jpg" alt="PERF Approach" /></p>






<ul>






  <li>Enter the transition level at LLSK4. When descending below this
level with the altimeter set to STD, the STD will start to blink on the
PFD.</li>






  <li>Entere either the MDA or the DH for the planned approach.</li>






  <li>Select either CONF3 of FULL for the flaps setting to be used on approach.</li>






</ul>








    
<h2>Go Around (Missed Approach)</h2>

<ul>








      <li>Clear any previous flight plan by clicking on the <em>CLR</em> key followed by the <em>FROM/TO</em> LSK.</li>








      <li>Set the origin and destination airports by entering them as ORIG/DEST (e.g. KLAX/KSLC) and clicking the <em>FROM/TO</em> LSK. This will load them as the first two waypoints on the F-PLN page.</li>








      <li>(optional) Set the alternate airport by entering its name and clicking the <em>ALTN</em> LSK.</li>








      <li>Set the cruising flight level by entering a FL value (in 100's of feet) and clicking the <em>CRZ FL/TEMP</em>
LSK. Note this will not change the autopilot's altitude setting. You
must do that separately. The cruising altitude will be used for TOD
calculations as noted above on the PROG page.</li>








      <li>Enter your radio callsign and click the <em>FLT NBR</em> LSK.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<p>The <em>LAT/LONG</em> fields will show your current position once you are airborne. <em>ALTN RTE, WIND</em> and <em>COST INDEX</em> are not currently supported.</p>








    
<p>If you save the flight (from the DATA page), the <em>CO RTE</em> field will be filled in with the filename.</p>







<p>On the INIT B page (reachable by the left/right cursors of the MCDU)
you can see your current ZFW (zero fuel weight), BLOCK fuel and TOW

<h1><a name="MCDUFPLN" id="MCDUFPLN"></a>F-PLN Page</h1>








    
<p>The Flight Plan page is where you will spend most of your time in
the MCDU window. This is where you specify what waypoints the aircraft
will pass through all the way from your origin to your destination. You
can:</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Add/delete  individual waypoints.</li>








      <li>Add waypoint via airways.</li>








      <li>Choose a SID (departure) and STAR (arrival).</li>








      <li>Get  information for your landing runway.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<p>Some 3rd party flight planning applications can export plans in the
format used by vasFMC. You can load these plans from the DATA page
instead of building them on the F-PLN page.</p>








    
<p><img style="width: 361px; height: 242px;" src="MCDUFPLNPage.jpg" alt="F-PLN Page" /></p>








    
<p>You can use the mouse wheel to scroll through the whole flight plan
as needed. The bottom line will always show the destination airport,
ETA (in UTC) and distance. <em>EFOB</em> (estimated fuel on board) is
not yet implemented. The screenshot above shows part of a flight plan
from LOWG&nbsp;(Graz) to LOWW (Vienna).</p>








    
<p>The top waypoint shows the most recently passed waypoint,
when you passed it (1338 UTC), and at what indicated speed and altitude
(154kts, 1526ft). In smaller print below it is the SID, STAR or airway
the waypoint is part of (e.g. XANU1G SID from LOWG) and the direction
(168 degrees) and distance (1nm) to the next waypoint (GRZ). If the
waypoint is not associated with a SID, STAR or airway, that part of the
2nd line will be blank.</p>








    
<p>The next waypoint (in white) shows the next waypoint we should pass
(GRZ) and an estimated arrival time (1338 UTC). The track and distance
fields are the same as described above. Since we haven't arrived there
yet the speed and altitude fields are empty, but you can see an
altitude restriction (+2200ft), this means we shall pass this waypoint
at or above 2200ft.</p>








    
<h2><a name="MCDUSIDSTAR" id="MCDUSIDSTAR"></a>Entering a SID or STAR</h2>








    
<ul>








      <li>Click the LSK for either the origin (SID) or destination (STAR) airport.</li>








      <li>Click the LSK for <em>DEPARTURE</em> or <em>ARRIVAL</em> as appropriate.</li>








      <li>Choose a runway. Some SIDs/STARs are only used for certain runways at an airport.</li>








      <li>Scroll through the list of SIDs/STARs to find the one you
want. A SID or STAR will be listed several times if it has multiple
transition points. When you click the LSK for a given SID/STAR the
transition point will be shown in the <em>TRANS</em> field in the upper right.</li>








      <li>Press the <em>INSERT</em> LSK when you have the procedure
and transition you want. The display will change to show you the
waypoints for the chosen SID/STAR. The ND will also show the chosen
route graphically.</li>








      <li>Choosing a new SID or STAR will replace the SID or STAR
which was in the flight plan before. You don't need to remove the
waypoints individually.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Waypoint formats</h2>








    
<p>A waypoint can be entered in several different ways:</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>As a named waypoint (e.g. PRINO).</li>








      <li>As lat/long coordinates in the Jeppesen format
Xdd.mm.t/Yddd.mm.t. Substitute "N" or "S" for "X" latitude, and "E" or
"W" for "Y" longitude. Note the longitude starts with three digits. The
format is degrees/minutes/tenths. A waypoint on a NAT Track can be
entered as N53.0.0/W20.0.0.</li>








      <li>As a place/bearing/distance tuple. A named waypoint is
followed by a (magnetic) bearing and distance from the waypoint. For
example, BLH/080/100 specifies a point 100 miles from the BLH VOR at a
bearing of 080 degrees. A waypoint created in this manner will be given
an artificial name beginning with "PBD".</li>








      <li>An overfly waypoint is entered by including an asterisk in the name (e.g. BLH* or *BLH).</li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Adding a waypoint</h2>








    
<p>A new waypoint can be inserted either before a selected waypoint.
For example you can insert waypoints before the destination airport to
define an approach.</p>








    
<p>Inserting a new waypoint before another:</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Scroll the list of waypoints until the one you want to insert before is visible.</li>








      <li>Enter the new waypoint  on your keyboard or the MCDU keypad.</li>








      <li>Press the LSK of the waypoint you want to insert <em>before</em>.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Deleting a waypoint</h2>








    
<ul>








      <li>Press the Backspace key on your keyboard or the CLR key on the MCDU keypad.</li>








      <li>Click the LSK of the waypoint to be deleted.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Adding an airway</h2>








    
<p>An airway is added as the airway name and the exit waypoint. For
example, J169/BLH. Note that the entrance and exit points for the
airway must be on the airway's official waypoint list as defined by the
national or regional aviation authority. This is part of the data that
is distributed by Navigraph.</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Click the LSK for the waypoint where you enter the airway.</li>








      <li>Enter the airway name and termination point, separated by a slash.</li>








      <li>Press the LSK for <em>VIA/GO TO [ ] / [ ].</em></li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Changing the destination</h2>








    
<p>If you must divert to a new destination you can enter it and clear
any STAR for your previous destination. The change will be reflected on
the INIT page and ND.</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Click the LSK for the waypoint where you want to depart from your existing flight plan.</li>








      <li>Enter the new destination airport and click the LSK for <em>NEW DEST [ ]</em>.</li>








      <li>The F-PLN page will be updated with the new destination, and any star for the previous destination will be erased.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<h2>Altitude &amp; speed restrictions</h2>








    
<p class="warning">The current release does not use&nbsp;speed
restrictions in any way, though this is planned for a future release.
For now you should consider these as reminders only.</p>








    
<p>To set altitude and/or speed restrictions for a given waypoint:</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>For an altitude restriction alone, enter the altitude in feet.</li>








      <li>For a speed restriction alone, enter the speed followed by a slash (e.g. "250/").</li>








      <li>For both restrictions enter the speed, a slash, and the altitude (e.g. "250/14000").</li>






  <li>Altitude restriction can be of the following types: "at" (e.g.
14000), "at or below" (e.g. -14000) or "at or above" (e.g. +14000).</li>








      <li>Click the right side LSK for the waypoint.</li>

<h1><a name="MCDUHolds" id="MCDUHolds"></a>Performing Holds</h1>








    
<p>When the skies are crowded as they often are during an online
fly-in, ATC may control the flow of traffic into a busy airport by
requiring aircraft to hold over a waypoint. Holds consist of an inbound
course, a turn direction and a leg length. vasFMC can automate holds
for you very simply. Note that the actual pattern flown depends on your
speed. Higher speeds will make wider turns and longer legs. Keeping
this constant is your responsibility.</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>On the F-PLN page, press the LSK for the waypoint you want to hold over.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<p><img src="MCDUHold1.jpg" height="221" width="363" /></p>








    
<ul>








      <li>Enter the inbound course direction and press the <em>INB CRS</em> LSK.</li>








      <li>Enter L or R for the turn direction (L is the default) and press the <em>TURN</em> LSK.</li>








      <li>Enter the length of time for each leg, in minutes, and press the <em>TIME</em> LSK.</li>








      <li>Press the <em>INSERT</em> LSK to insert the hold in the flight plan.</li>








      <li>Press the F-PLN page key to view the modified flight plan.
The ND will also show the holding pattern as a loop to the left or
right of the waypoint.</li>








    
</ul>








    
<p><img src="MCDUHold2.jpg" height="221" width="363" /></p>








    
<p>In the example above notice that the MCDU now reads HOLD R at RYANN, and has an <em>EXIT</em>
LSK on the right side. When you arrive at RYANN the aircraft will make
a right turn to the reciprocal of whatever inbound course you set for
the hold (i.e. it will turn away from the inbound course). It will then
fly that reciprocal course for the length of time you entered for the
leg, then make another right turn to the inbound course. It will keep
making these turns until you tell it to exit the holding pattern.</p>








    
<ul>








      <li>To exit the hold, press the <em>EXIT</em> LSK. The aircraft
will continue holding in the pattern until it comes back to the inbound
waypoint. Then it will move on to the next waypoint in the plan.</li>








      <li>You can exit the hold prematurely (before coming back to
the waypoint inbound) by removing the waypoint from the plan (see above
for how to remove a waypoint). The aircraft will immediately turn to
intercept the next waypoint.</li>

<h2>SETTINGS</h2>








    
<p>This page contains miscellaneous parameters that are unique to
vasFMC (i.e. they are not present in a real world FMC). All the
settings have two choices which can be toggled with the respective LSK.</p>

<ul>








      <li>INPUTAREAS will draw boxes around the mouse button hotspots on the <a href="MFCURef.htm">FCU</a>. This helps new users to remember them.</li>








      <li>SOUNDS toggles the vasFMC sounds (like voice altitude callouts) on or off.</li>






  <li>SOUND CHANNELS enables simultaneous playback of vasFMC sounds from different sources (e.g. co-pilot or computer callouts).</li>








      

      <li>TIME SYNC will synchronize the flight simulator's time with the real world.</li>








      <li>DATE SYNC will synchronize the flight simulartor's date with the real world.</li>

  <li>TCAS toggles the display of other traffic on the ND.</li>






  <li>FLY BY WIRE toggles the fly by wire system. The fly by wire
system is currently tuned for the project airbus models and may not
work with other aircraft.</li>






  <li>A/THR MODE sets if&nbsp;either the FLIGHTSIM or VASFMC shall
handle the autothrottle. The VASFMC mode may not work with all aircraft
models.</li>






  <li>AIRBUS A/THR When set to yes, your throttle levelwill behave liks
in the real Airbus with detends for IDLE, CLIMB, FLEX/MCT and TOGA.</li>






  <li>AIRBUS FLAPS en/disables Airbus like flap handling, e.g. flaps "1" and "1+F" handling.</li>
