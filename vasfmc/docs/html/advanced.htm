<h1>Advanced Flight</h1>








    
<p>This chapter describes some of the advanced features of vasFMC,
parts of this chapter are based on Airbus procedures and features.</p>





<p>Important: Make sure you successfully accomplished the first flight chapter before fiddling around with the advanced features.</p>





<h2>Prerequisites</h2>





This chapter relies on the following prerequisites:<br />





<br />





<ul>





  <li>You are using the vasFMC A-Style.</li>





  <li>You have a hardware throttle lever (as part of a joystick or a separate one).</li>





  <li>The following settings on MCDU MENU&nbsp;SETTINGS page are active:</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>SOUNDS is set to ON.</li>





    <li>A/THR MODE is set to VASFMC.</li>





    <li>AIRBUS A/THR is set to YES.</li>





    <li>Set the other options according to your needs.</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>





</ul>





<br />





I also recomend to use vasFMC in combination with the MS FS Project Airbus models as these were used during the development.
<h2>Airbus A/THR Mode</h2>





If the&nbsp;Airbus autothrottle mode is active, your throttle will behave differently to what you are used to.<br />





<br />





<span style="font-weight: bold;">First</span>, the range of your throttle lever is divided by several detents:<br />





<br />





<ul>





  <li>IDLE<br />





When your throttle lever is fully back (&lt; 2%), it is in the IDLE detent.<br />





  </li>





  <li>CL (climb)<br />





This detent is reached as soon as&nbsp;your throttle lever is advanced to&nbsp;81% or beyond. <br />





Note: This detent is used most of the time when airborne.</li>





  <li>FLX/MCT (flex / max. continous)<br />





This detent is reached as soon as&nbsp;your throttle lever is advanced to 92% or beyond.</li>





  <li>TOGA<br />





This&nbsp;detent is reached as soon as&nbsp;your throttle lever is advanced to 99% or beyond.</li>





</ul>





<br />





Note: The percentages mentioned above may be configured in the
autothrottle.cfg file located in the vasFMC configuration directory.
Make sure the flightsim and vasFMC are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> running while changing the values!<br />





<br />





<span style="font-weight: bold;">Second</span>, your throttle lever is
not directly connected to your engines anymore. In the Airbus mode the
throttle lever commands a N1 value, thus every position of your lever
is equal to a calulated N1 value.&nbsp;<br />





<br />





<ul>





  <li>At the IDLE detent the lever commands idle thrust (the lowest thrust possible).</li>





  <li>At the CL detent the lever commands climb thrust which depends on the climb thrust setting made on the MCDU PERF CLIMB page.</li>





  <li>At the FLX/MCT detent the lever commands FLEX thrust (max. cont.
is not implemented yet). The FLEX thrust depends on the setting made on
the MCDU PERF TAKEOFF page.</li>





  <li>At the TOGA detent the lever commands max. possible thrust.</li>





  <li>In between the IDLE and the CL detent the lever commands an adequate N1 value between idle and climb thrust.</li>





</ul>





<br />





<span style="font-weight: bold;">Third</span>, the following facts hold:<br />





<br />





<ul>





  <li>The commanded N1 value is shown on the upper ECAM display by white bugs at the N1 display.</li>





  <li>When moving the throttle lever into a detent (except for the IDLE
detent) you will hear a click sound for each detent passed followed by
a&nbsp;callout announcing the current thrust setting.</li>





  <li>When advancing&nbsp;the throttle lever to or beyond the FLX/MCT
detent, the A/THR will automatically engage and will remain so even if
you move the throttle lever back to the range between the CL and the
IDLE detent.</li>





  <li>To disengage the A/THR either move your throttle lever into the
IDLE detent (this only works on the ground) or move your throttle lever
between the CL and the IDLE detent and press the A/THR button on the
FCU.</li>





  <li>Once the A/THR is&nbsp;engaged it can not be disangaged as long as&nbsp;the throttle lever&nbsp;is at or beyond the CL detent.</li>





  <li>You will hear a single chime sound and the text is shown "A/THR
OFF" on the upper ECAM for 10 seconds if the A/THR is disengaged.<br />





  </li>





</ul>





<br />





<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fourth</span>, the following PFD thrust announcements (located on the top left of the PFD) exist:<br />





<br />





<ul>





  <li>"Empty"<br />





No A/THR mode is active.</li>





  <li>SPEED<br />





The speed (IAS) hold mode is active.</li>





  <li>MACH<br />





The mach hold mode is active.</li>





  <li>MAN TOGA<br />





The A/THR is set to max. thrust.</li>





  <li>MAN FLX<br />





The A/THR is set to FLEX thrust.</li>





  <li>THR MCT<br />





The A/THR is set to max. continous thrust (not fully implemented yet).</li>





  <li>THR CLB<br />
The A/THR is set to climb thrust.</li>
  <li>THR IDLE<br />





The A/THR commands IDLE thrust.</li>





  <li>THR LVR<br />





When the A/THR is engaged and the throttle lever is located below the
CL detent, the A/THR sets the thrust adequate to the throttle lever
(thus the thrust will be below the climb thrust setting).</li>





  <li>LVR CLB (flashes on the 3rd row of the thrust announcements).<br />





When airborne and above the thrust reduction altitude (as set on the
MCDU PERF TAKEOFF page) with the throttle lever not in the CL detent,
the A/THR (if engaged) reminds the pilot to move the throttle
lever&nbsp;to the CL detent. If the throttle lever is not moved to the
CL detent after 10 seconds, a repetitive CHIME sound will be triggered.<br />





    <br />





  </li>





</ul>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fifth</span>, how to use the Airbus A/THR:<br />





<br />





<ul>





  <li>On the ground while taxiing, the throttle lever shall not be moved beyond 40% N1. This should be enough for taxi.</li>





  <li>At takeoff, advance the throttle lever to about 45% and watch the N1 display on the upper ECAM.</li>





  <li>If the engines are responsive and stable, advance the throttle lever to either the FLX/MCT or the TOGA detent.</li>





  <li>Check if the following&nbsp;thrust callout is correct according
to your expected setting, if not move the throttle lever to the correct
position.</li>





  <li>When airborne and passing the thrust reduction altitude (as set
on the MCDU PERF TAKEOFF page) move the throttle lever back to the CL
detent.</li>





  <li>From now on, the throttle lever remains in the CL detent until the A/THR is disengaged for landing.</li>





  <li>When switching to manual thrust during the approach, move the
throttle lever back until the white bugs at the upper ECAM N1 display
reach the current N1 value. This is done to avoid a rapid thrust change
on A/THR disengage.</li>





  <li>When reaching the correct throttle lever position disengage the A/THR.</li>





  <li>From now on you have manual control over the thrust.</li>





  <li> Move the throttle lever to IDLE when approximately 20ft above the ground. You will hear a RETARD callout if not doing so.<br />





  </li>





</ul>





<br />





<h2>FSUIPC Control</h2>





If you are using&nbsp;vasFMC with the MS Flightsimulator and own a
registered version FSUIPC you can control vasFMC via various FSUIPC
offsets. For details refer to the fsuipc.offsets.txt readme file
located in the docs/help directory of your vasFMC installation. The
file can also be viewed via the help menu of the vasFMC standalone
version.
<h2>Checklists</h2>





vasFMC&nbsp;comes with fully configurable spoken checklists which are
located inside the checklists directory of the vasFMC installation. The
loaded checklists depends on the loaded aircraft data profile which can
be selected on the MCDU MENU FMGC page.<br />





Note: At the time being vasFMC only comes with an Airbus checklist. This may change in the future depending on user input.<br />





<br />





To view the checklist inside the FMC go the MCDU MENU CHECKLIST page,
the&nbsp;bottom LSKs can be used to go forward and backward in the
checklists. You may also use the hidden clickspot on the FCU (right
below the SPD MACH button) to advance through the checklists.<br />





<br />





<h2>The&nbsp;Chronology of a vasFMC Flight - A Tutorial</h2>





This chapter gives you a&nbsp;chronological tutorial of a flight
using&nbsp;the advanced vasFMC features. This guide is not complete in
respect to the actions performed during a flight and mainly focuses on
the vasFMC features. It is&nbsp;assumed that&nbsp;you have loaded
either the A320 or A318 aircraft data profile on the MCDU MENU FMGC
page and that you are using the Airbus A/THR mode.<br />

<ul>





  <li>Preflight</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>Go to the MCDU MENU CHECKLIST page and work through the preparation checklist.</li>





    <li>If possible load your flight plan from VROUTE via the MCDU MENU ACARS VROUTE page.</li>





    <li>Check the weather of your departure and destination airport via the MCDU MENU ACARS WEATHER page.</li>





    <li>Make sure no orange fields are left on the INIT page (except for the CO RTE field which may be left empty).</li>





    <li>On the MCDU PERF TAKEOFF page do:</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>





      <li>Set the V1, VR and V2 speeds.</li>





      <li>Set the transition altitude.</li>





      <li>Check that the thrust reduction/acceleration altitude values are correct.<br />





They should be 1000ft above the field elevation per default.</li>





      <li>Enter the takeoff flaps setting.</li>





      <li>Enter the takeoff elevator trim, this will set the trim of your aircraft automatically.</li>





      <li>Change the FLEX takeoff thrust if necessary.</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>





    <li>On the MCDU PERF CLB page do:</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>





      <li>Set the PRESEL SPD field to the IAS value to be used after reaching the acceleration altitude.<br />





For some airports/SIDs you will have to change this to a value below 250kts depending on the SID restrictions.</li>





      <li>Set the PRESEL MACH field to the requested climb mach value.</li>





      <li>Change the climb N1 values if necessary.</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>





    <li>On the MCDU PERF CRZ page do:</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>





      <li>Set the PRESEL field to your requested cruise mach value.</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>





    <li>On the MCDU PERF DES page do:</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>





      <li>Set the PRESEL fields to your requested descent mach and IAS values.</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>





    <li>On the MCDU F-PLN page do:</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>





      <li>Select the requested departure runways and SID route.</li>





      <li>Switch the ND to PLAN mode.</li>





      <li>Check your routing by scrolling through the waypoints of the F-PLN page.</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>





    <li>Check your fuel load.<br />





    </li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>





  <li>Taxi</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>Check the taxi checklist items.</li>





    <li>Make sure the flight director is switched on.</li>





    <li>Check the armed FD modes on the PFD flight mode announciator (FMA), they should be OP CLB and NAV.<br />





This means that after reaching the acceleration altitude the FD will
enter the OP CLB (flight level change) vertical mode and after reaching
30ft radar altitude&nbsp;the FD will enter the NAV (LNAV) lateral mode.</li>





    <li>If you don't want to enter the NAV mode you may click with the
right mouse button onto the HDG button on the FCU. This will arm the
HDG hold mode, thus the FD will maintain the runway heading after
takeoff.</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>





  <li>Takeoff</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>Check the takeoff checklist items.</li>





    <li>Advance the throttle levers to either the FLEX or TOGA detent.</li>





    <li>As soon as engines reach a N1 value greater than 85% or
the aircraft reaches a speed greater than 90kts,&nbsp;the FD will
engage with the vertical SRS (speed reference system) and lateral RWY
mode, this is shown on the PFD FMA.</li>



    <li>At 80kts, V1 and VR you will hear callouts according to the speeds entered on the MCDU.</li>





    

    <li>When airborne the vertical flight director bar guides you to keep the IAS between V2 and V2 + 15kts.<br />





The lateral FD mode changes to RWY TRK and the lateral flight director bar guides you to keep the runway track.</li>





    <li>When passing 30ft radar altitude the lateral FD mode changes to either NAV or HDG, depending on your previous selection.</li>





    <li>When passing the acceleration altitude the IAS value on the FCU
changes to the value entered on the MCDU PERF CLB page and the FD
vertical mode changes to OP CLB. This means that the thrust is kept
steady and your climb rate depends on your speed. The flight director will guide you to keep the climb speed. </li>





    <li>When passing the thrust reduction altitude (which in most cases
is the same as the acceleration altitude) the A/THR system reminds you
to pull the throttle lever back to the CL detent which you should do.</li>





    <li>You may engage the AP at any time as soon as above 100ft radar altitude.</li>





    <li>While accelerating to the climb speed make sure to retract the flaps accordingly.</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>





  <li>Climb</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>When passing the transition altitude switch the altimeters to STD.</li>





    <li>When reaching 10000ft increase&nbsp;the AP speed value on the
FCU, I personally use&nbsp;speeds between 280 and 300 kts for the
Airbus.</li>





    <li>The AP will automatically switch to the climb mach value entered on the MCDU PERF CLB page when reaching the appropriate speed.</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>





  <li>Cruise</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>When reaching the cruise flight level the AP changes to ALT
hold mode and sets the cruising mach value entered on the MCDU PERF CRZ
page.</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>





  <li>Descent</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>When ready for descent, select a lower altitude on the FCU and
click onto the ALT button. This will change the AP vertical mode to OP
DES (flight level change) meaning that the thrust will be reduced to
idle and your descent rate depends on the IAS.</li>





    <li>Set your arrival runway and approach procedures (STAR, TRANSITION) via the F-PLN page.</li>





    <li>Check the weather of your&nbsp;destination airport via the MCDU MENU ACARS WEATHER page.</li>





    <li>On the MCDU PERF APPR page do:</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    <ul>





      <li>Enter the transition flight level.</li>





      <li>Enter either the DH or the MDA for your approach.</li>





    
    
    
    
    
    </ul>





    <li>Before passing 10000ft set the AP speed value on the FCU to 250kts or less.</li>





    <li>When passing the transition level switch the altimeters to the appropriate value.</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  </ul>





  <li>Approach</li>





  
  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>When near the airfield engage the approach phase on the MCDU
