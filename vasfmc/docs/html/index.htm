<h1><a name="IndexNavdata" id="IndexNavdata"></a>Navigation Data</h1>











<p>The navigation database used by vasFMC is directly supported by
Navigraph which updates the data files for each monthly AIRAC cycle.
Please <a target="_blank" href="http://www.navigraph.com/www/fmsdata.asp">see  Navigraph</a>
for information on obtaining the data. The Navigraph installer will ask
for the folder where you installed vasFMC and will install the files in
the proper subfolder.</p>











<p class="warning">Note that this data is not the same as that used by
the built-in MSFS GPS. Real world navigation data changes over time,
but the MSFS GPS data format is not supported by Navigraph. This is
another good reason to use vasFMC instead of the built-in GPS.</p>











<h1><a name="Installation" id="Installation"></a>Installation of the Windows Standalone Version</h1>









<p>vasFMC
comes packaged as a standard executable installer. As with any
installer, just run the program and follow the prompts. The default
installation directory is C:\Program Files\vasfmc2, but you can change
this during the installation.</p>









<p>vasFMC runs as a separate program independently from your flight
simulator. To start vasFMC from your Windows start menu, select the
vasFMC program group and the vasFMC item within it. If you use multiple
monitors putting the vasFMC windows on a separate monitor is a
convenient way of having them visible at all times. The window
positions will be remembered from the previous placement and will
always show up where you place them.</p>











<p>vasFMC communicates with MSFS through the free version of the <a href="http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html" target="_blank">FSUIPC</a>
library. FSUIPC is not included with vasFMC, however it is widely
available on flight simulator enthusiast sites as well as from its
author at <a href="http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html" target="_blank">www.schiratti.com/dowson.html</a>.&nbsp;Some features of vasFMC require a registered version of&nbsp;FSUIPC.</p>











<h1>Installation of the&nbsp;MSFS&nbsp;2004 Gauge Version</h1>











<p>vasFMC comes packaged as a standard executable installer. As with
any installer, just run the program and follow the prompts. You must
provide the root directory of your FS2004 to the installer!&nbsp;During
the gauge installation a new folder will be created under
your FS9 Aircraft folder: vasfmc_panel_a320. This contains the default
vasFMC Airbus panel which uses the vasFMC gauges.&nbsp;Besides the
vasFMC gauge version installer you can also find various
Project Airbus model downloads on the VAS homepage, all of them must be
installed into the FS2004 aircraft directory and are vasFMC-ready.</p>









If you want to integrate vasFMC into any other aircraft panel you will have to adapt the aircraft.cfg file as follows:

<blockquote>





  
  
  
  
  
  <p class="style1">[fltsim]<br />










        alias=vasfmc_panel_a320</p>










    </blockquote>











<p>This is how the gauges are used in vasfmc_panel_a320/panel.cfg:</p>











<blockquote>





  
  
  
  
  
  <p class="style1">gauge14=vasfmcgau!pfd,     28,708, 342,342, builtin id10001 a_style<br />










        gauge15=vasfmcgau!nd,     436,708, 342,342, builtin id10002 a_style<br />










        gauge16=vasfmcgau!uecam, 1160,690, 316,316, builtin id10003 a_style<br />










        gauge17=vasfmcgau!fcu,    601,433</p>










    </blockquote>











<p>The first two extra parameters ("<span class="style1">builtin id10001</span>")
are necessary to let you left click on the gauge to make the gauge larger. The 3rd extra
parameter controls the gauge style and can be either "<span class="style1">a_style</span>" or "<span class="style1">b_style</span>" (see the <a href="NDRef.htm">ND</a>
and PFD chapters for the differences in the two styles). Please note that the styles must not be mixed. The panel.cfg
file also has entries for Window04 through Window07 which can be used
as guides in building your own panel.</p>









vasFMC communicates with MSFS through the free version of the <a href="http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html" target="_blank">FSUIPC</a>
library. FSUIPC is not included with vasFMC, however it is widely
available on flight simulator enthusiast sites as well as from its
author at <a href="http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html" target="_blank">www.schiratti.com/dowson.html</a>. Some features of vasFMC require a registered version of&nbsp;FSUIPC.

<h1>Installation on Mac OSX</h1>





<p>Unpack the contents of the .zip-file to any location of your liking. No further installation necessary. vasFMC starts by
double-clicking vasfmc.app
</p>






<h1>Installation on Linux</h1>





<p>Unpack the contents of the .zip-file to any location in your $home-directory. We do NOT encourage installation in /usr/bin
and /usr/lib respectively, as this is not tested. vasFMC is completely self-contained in its folder, breaking up the structure
may cause vasFMC to not find navigational data, aircraft performance data and so on. <br />





Start vasFMC by starting the vasfmc.sh shell script from the terminal, not by starting the vasfmc binary itself.
For convenience, you can create a desktop shortcut to the shellscript. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
When doing so, it is
neccesary to set the vasfmc-folder as "working directory" in which
vasfmc.sh starts, otherwise you will get an error because vasFMC
cannot find navigational data, performance data, etc.
</p>






<h1>Setting up integration in X-Plane</h1>






<p>vasFMC communicates with X-Plane via the xpfmcconn plugin that <strong>comes as a separate download</strong>.</p>





<p>Install the plugin by unpacking the xpfmcconn directory to YOUR_X-PLANE_DIR/Resources/plugins/ <br />





<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The plugin is a fat plugin, so the folder "xpfmcconn" with its contained files "lin.xpl", "mac.xpl" and
"win.xpl" must reside inside the Resources/plugins/ folder. Never drop one file alone to Resources/plugins/ or the plugin
will not work.</p>






<p>The vasFMC X-Plane integration is driven by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.canaerospace.com/">CAN Aerospace</a> technology: &nbsp;  <img style="width: 158px; height: 94px;" alt="CAN Aerospace" src="driven.jpg" align="top" /><br />






</p>











<h1><a name="RemoteSys" id="RemoteSys"></a>Use on a Remote System for MS FlightSimulator</h1>











<p>The standalone version of vasFMC can be run on a separate system by using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html">WideFS</a>.</p>











<p class="warning">Be sure to start the simulator <em>before</em> starting vasFMC. Starting these in the wrong order can cause WideFS to consume 99% of the CPU.</p>












<h1>Use on a Remote System for X-Plane</h1>





<p>
vasFMC and the X-Plane plugin communicate via a UDP multicast. This works on the very same machine or with multiple
machines without changing IP addresses, <strong>provided your firewalls allow incoming UDP connections.</strong>
To ensure that, open ports 50707 and 63703 for UDP traffic on the firewalls of <strong>both</strong> machines.
</p>





<div class="warning"><em><strong>If network connection does not work:</strong></em><br />





<p>
The support of UDP multicast is highly dependent on the network hardware you use. Stoneage network equipment may not be able
to distribute multicasts. In that case, it is strongly recommended to upgrade your network infrastructure.
As a workaround you can use the traditional way of inserting normal IP addresses.</p>


<p>To do this, locate the file "fsaccess_xplane.cfg" in the cfg folder of your vasFMC installation. Edit the line<br />





</p>




<pre style="display: inline;">hostaddress=239.40.41.42</pre>




<br />





To read<br />





<pre style="display: inline;">hostadress=The IP address of the computer running X-Plane<br /></pre>




<br />






In X-Plane, locate the file "xpfmcconn.cfg" in YOUR_X-PLANE_DIR/Resources/plugins/xpfmcconn and change the line<br />


<br />





<pre style="display: inline;">hostaddress=239.40.41.42</pre>




<br />





To read<br />





<pre style="display: inline;">hostadress=The IP address of the computer running vasFMC</pre>





<br class="warning" />






</div>





<p class="warning">
<em><strong>Note for Wireless LANs (WiFi):</strong></em><br />




The speed and reliability of multicast is dependent on the network stack implementation of your chipset.
Transfer rates on the same machine differ extremely running Linux or Windows.
Also some wireless access points and routers have problems handling dense UDP multicast traffic.<br />
In case of low transfer rates the vasFMC displays will react slowly and with stuttering and jumping.
For optimum results, we strongly recommend the use of a wired ethernet connection between the machines running vasFMC and X-Plane.<br />
