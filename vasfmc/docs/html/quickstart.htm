<p>vasFMC can operate either as a standalone program or as gauges in
your cockpit panel. We recommend that you run vasFMC as a standalone
program initially to acquaint yourself with all the functions. This
example is written from that perspective.</p>





    
<p>When you run vasFMC as a standalone program the console window will
appear. It lets you set some program-wide options from the menu bar and
has pushbuttons which toggle the dfferent windows. Each window is
described in its own reference chapter in this manual.</p>

<p>Important: Make sure that the Airbus A/THR mode is deactivated on the MCDU MENU/SETTINGS page!</p>

<ul>





      <li>Push the window visibility buttons so that you have the
left MCDU, left ND, left PFD, ECAM and FCU windows visible. The "left" and "right"
versions of some windows are identical; only one of each needs to be
visible.</li>





      <li>On the menu bar you can select two styles of display for some of the windows. Style A is shown here and is the default.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p>We are going to fly from London Heathrow (EGLL) to Paris De Gaulle
(LFPG). We will depart EGLL using the MID4F SID with the MID
transition, cross the channel on the M605 airway, and arrive at LFPG
using the DPE4H STAR with the DPE transition. We will be cruising at an
altitude of 25,000 feet. </p>





    
<p>The complete route is: MID4F.MID SFD M605 DPE.DPE4H.</p>





    
<p class="warning">SIDs and STARs change occasionally. This example is
based on the 0609 AIRAC which comes&nbsp;with vasFMC. The specific
SID/STAR which is current when you read this may be different. The
method of entering them in the MCDU is the same, however.</p>





    
<ul>





      <li>Start the flight simulator.</li>





      <li>Do not set any special weather. Wind direction affects
which runways are in use and for the sake of this example we want calm
winds on the ground so you can use the runways described here.</li>





      <li>Start vasFMC.</li>





      <li>vasFMC depends on the Battery and Avionics being turned on
from your cockpit panel, and the windows/gauges will be blank until
they are. This means they will be very likely be blank while you are
selecting an aircraft and airport on the Create A Flight screen of
MSFS. If the Battery and Avionics switches come on automatically when
you see the cockpit, the vasFMC windows/gauges will also come on.
Otherwise ensure those switches are turned on in your cockpit panel.</li>

<h1><a name="BasicFlightInfo" id="BasicFlightInfo"></a>Enter Flight Information in the MCDU Window</h1>





    
<p>The MCDU display is organized as two columns (left &amp; right),
each with six rows. The six buttons on each side of the display are
called Line Select Keys, abbreviated as <strong>LSK</strong> (see highlighted area below).</p>





    
<p>Changing parameters in the MCDU consists of entering the data and
pressing one of the LSKs to store it. The data may be entered from your
computer keyboard or from the alphanumeric pad on the MCDU itself. Use
only lowercase letters when using your computer keyboard (they will be
displayed as uppercase). You can use the MCDU CLR key or the backspace
key on your computer keyboard to make corrections. The line showing the
written text is called scratchpad and is the bottom line of the MCDU.</p>





    
<p><img src="MCDULSK.jpg" alt="Line Select Key" height="264" width="378" /></p>





    
<ul>





      <li>Press the LSK to the right of the CONFIRM entry. We will use the default aircraft parameters for this flight.<br />



As the default parameters assume you are flying an Airbus A320,
the&nbsp;weight of your actual aircraft may influence the display and
behavior or vasFMC.<br />



To ensure correct behavior use either an A320 or an aircraft within the same weight class (e.g. B737) for this flight.</li>





      <li>Press the INIT key to make sure you are working with the INIT page.</li>





      <li>Press the backspace key on your keyboard or the CLR key on
the MCDU keypad (CLR will be shown at the bottom left of the screen).
Then press the LSK next to the<em> FROM/TO </em>line  (this is the topmost LSK on the right side of the MCDU window). This will clear any previous flight plan.</li>





      <li>Enter EGLL/LFPG using either your computer keyboard or the keys in the MCDU window.</li>

<ul>





      <li>If you like you may enter an alternate airport to be used
in case the planned destination is unreachable due to weather and press
the LSK next to <em>ALTN</em>.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<ul>





      <li>Enter your radio callsign or flight number (e.g. AAL123) and press the LSK next to <em>FLT NBR</em>.</li>





      <li>Enter 250 and press the LSK next to <em>CRZ FL/TEMP</em>.
This is our cruising altitude in "flight level" terms. (FLs are given
in hundreds of feet, so&nbsp;250=25,000ft and 120=12,000ft.)</li>

</ul>





    
<ul>





      <li>Press the LSK next to SFD. We are now going to add the M605
airway to the route, entering the airway at SFD and leaving it at DPE.</li>

<ul>





      <li>Enter M605/DPE and press the LSK next to <em>VIA/GO TO [ ] [ ]</em>.
This tells vasFMC to go from SFD to DPE via the M605 airway. The screen
will change back to the flight plan page where you can see the
waypoints SFD07, WAFFU, HARDY, XIDIL, DPE06 and DPE have been added
after SFD. vasFMC will add all waypoints along the airway to the plan
up to and including the exit from the airway.</li>

      <li>The next page shows the arrivals we can choose from for
this runway. Scroll down to the entry for DPE4H.09L and press the LSK
for it.</li>





      <li>There will be a list of transitions for the arrival on the
right side of the display. Scroll down and select MERUE. This will
bring us into runway 09L from the west.</li>

<ul>





      <li>Press the <em>INSERT</em> key to add this arrival to our
flight plan. The screen will change back to the flight plan page where
you can see the waypoints for the arrival have been added.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p class="warning">Note that we have not added any approach waypoints.
The actual approach used will vary according to factors such as runway
assignment, winds and visibility. If we know ahead of time what
approach to use we can enter those waypoints manually. An example is
shown in the approach section below.</p>





    
<h1><a name="ConfigND" id="ConfigND"></a>Configure the Nav Display (ND)</h1>





    
<p>The ND window is versatile and is where most of your attention will
be focused during the flight. The features it displays are selectable
in the ND (EFIS) part of the FCU window as shown in the highlighted area below.</p>





    
<p><img src="QSFCU.jpg" alt="FCU ND selection" height="100" width="600" /></p>





    
<p>Take a moment to left and right click on the knobs to see how they
affect the ND window. Left clicking (or clicking to the left of a knob)
rotates it counter-clockwise, and right clicking (or clicking to the
right of a knob) moves it clockwise. You can also use the mouse wheel on the button to change it.</p>





    
<ul>





      <li>Left or right click on the left knob until it points to <em>PLAN</em>.</li>





      <li>Left or right click on the right knob until it points to <em>20</em>.</li>





      <li>In the MCDU window, select the F-PLN page. Scroll through
the waypoints (using either the arrow keys or the mouse wheel)
and notice how the ND changes with it. This is an easy way to check
that the flight path doesn't have any waypoints that backtrack or go to
far out of the way.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p align="left"><img src="QSND1.jpg" alt="Plan mode" height="357" width="338" />&nbsp;</p>





    
<ul>





      <li>In the FCU window, select the <em>ARC</em> mode for the ND.
In this mode up is always the direction we're facing, so the compass
will move with the aircraft. Note that the flight plan is shown as a
dashed green line at the moment. The dashed line indicates the autopilot
is not yet set to follow the plan. The plan is always visible, though. If
you can't see the flight plan line you may be on the wrong runway. This
example uses runway 27R at EGLL.</li>





      <li>In the FCU window, click the <em>VOR</em> button above the  knobs in the ND area. You may need to expand the range to <em>40</em>
on the right knob to see them all. This will make nearby VORs visible
in the ND. Similarly you can display crossing restrictions (<em>CSTR</em>), coastlines (<em>TERR</em>), NDBs (<em>NDB</em>) and airports (<em>ARPT</em>).</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p align="left"><img src="QSND3.jpg" alt="Arc mode" height="357" width="338" /></p>





    
<h1><a name="NavFreq" id="NavFreq"></a>Set the Navigation Frequencies</h1>





    
<ul>





      <li>On the MCDU, press the RAD NAV key. This page displays the
frequencies in use by the aircraft's navigational instruments.
Different aircraft will have different configurations of navigational
gear. vasFMC provides access for 2 VOR/ILS and 2 ADF tuners, how many of them are active depends on your aircraft.</li>





      <li>Enter MID (or a specific frequency such as 114.0) from your keyboard or the MCDU keypad, then press the LSK next to the <em>VOR1/FREQ</em>
line. This will set the VOR1 tuner to the MID VOR, which we'll be
passing over. The VOR1 freq will change to the MID frequency. We won't
be using this VOR for navigation on this flight but you may want to
know where nearby navaids are in the event you are given new
instructions by ATC.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p align="left"><img src="QSMCDU8.jpg" alt="VOR setting" height="269" width="377" /></p>





    
<h1><a name="GoFly" id="GoFly"></a>Get Flying!</h1>





    
<ul>





      <li>Set up your aircraft and panel autopilot as you normally
would before takeoff and line up on runway 27R. Don't worry about
setting up the vasFMC autopilot (FCU) for now.</li>





      <li>Look at the Primary Flight Display window (PFD). Notice
that many of the autopilot settings are shown here, along with most
everything else you'll need for instrument flight.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p align="left"><img src="QSPFD1.jpg" alt="PFD" height="450" width="450" /></p>





    
<ul>





      <li>Now look at the ND window. The dashed line shows the flight
plan programmed into the CDU. When the line is dashed like, vasFMC is
not controlling the flight path (i.e. autopilot). The line will be
solid when vasFMC is controlling navigation as we will see later.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p align="left"><img src="QSND2.jpg" alt="Arc mode" height="357" width="338" /></p>





    
<ul>





      <li>In the FCU window, make sure the FD button is turned off
for now. vasFMC can automate many of the takeoff procedures but that is
beyond the scope of this tutorial. (Note: The FD can not be activated if no engine is running.)</li>





    
</ul>





    
<ul>





      <li>The PFD and ND will track your movements in real time. The
PFD will show many of the autopilot/autothrottle settings. The ND shows
our ground and true airspeed along with the next waypoint, its
distance, and ETA.</li>





      <li>Take off as you normally would, stabilizing the speed and
climb rate and head for the first set of waypoints. You may engage the
panel autopilot and autothrottle if you wish. Turn left as indicated by
the flight path shown in the ND.</li>





      <li>In the MCDU window press the DIR key. The next page will
show a list of the upcoming waypoints in order from top to bottom. If
we engage the vasFMC heading control at this point it will try to fly
the aircraft back to the direct line between the previous and next
waypoints. This is not realistic. What we want instead is to turn from
our present position to intercept a waypoint on our route.</li>





      <li>Press the LSK next to the  waypoint LON8, then press the LSK for <em>INSERT</em>. Note how the ND changes the projected course, and the F-PLN page shows our present position as <em>T-P</em>.</li>





      <li>In the FCU window left click on the heading knob. The path
line in the ND will change from dashed to solid to indicate vasFMC is
controlling lateral navigation (LNAV). Also note that the FD indicator
has come on in the FCU window.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p align="left"><img src="QSND5.jpg" alt="Lateral navigation (LNAV)" height="357" width="338" /></p>





    
<ul>





      <li>Notice that the wind direction and speed are also displayed
in the upper left corner along with our ground speed (GS) and true
airspeed (TAS).</li>





    
</ul>





    
<ul>





      <li>As we continue our climb you will notice an arrow in the ND
window pointing toward the flight path. This marks the estimated Top Of
Climb (TOC) for our current speed and rate of climb.</li>

      <li>In the MCDU window, scroll down to the DPE waypoint. Notice
that speed and altitude restrictions have been added for you. You are
expected to be no more than 280 knots and at 21,000 ft by the time you
get to DPE. vasFMC will calculate the Top of Descent point using "at" and "at or below" altitude restrictions that are in place.</li>

      <li>In the ND window, the estimated top of descent is shown as
an arrow pointing away from the flight path. This is where you should
reduce thrust and begin descending in order to make the 21,000 ft
restriction at DPE. This arrow is only shown when climbing or on level flight and will disappear when descending.<br />

<h1><a name="AddWaypoint" id="AddWaypoint"></a>Manually Add Waypoints for Approach</h1>





    
<p>The arrival we are using on this flight actually lines us up very
nicely with runway 09L. Other arrivals, particularly in the USA, only
get you close to the destination airport. From the arrival termination
point you may have several approaches that you can use to get you to a
particular runway. The waypoints for an approach can be added in
exactly the same manner as we used to add the SFD waypoint at the beginning of this flight.</p>





    
<ul>





      <li>Enter the waypoint name on the F-PLN page.</li>





      <li>Press the left LSK for the waypoint to insert the new waypoint before.</li>





    
</ul>





    
<p align="left">The approach for LFPG runway 09L calls for us to be at
3000 ft at a distance of 8nm from the ILS (or 6.9nm from the CGN VOR).
Other arrivals and approaches may call for altitude restrictions at
certain waypoints.</p>





    
<ul>





      <li>As we approach our estimated TOD we slow down and set the
autopilot to descend to our glideslope intercept of 3000 ft. The arrow
pointing toward the flight path in the ND shows us where we will reach
that altitude at our current ground speed and rate of descent. Adjust
both within realistic limits so that you make the altitude restiction
as required.</li>

<h1><a name="Landing" id="Landing"></a>Landing</h1>





    
<ul>




  <li>The ND in Plan mode will keep you apprised of the wind direction
and speed so you can adjust your heading to compensate if you are
flying by hand.</li>





      <li>Disengage the autopilot and land as you normally would.</li>





      <li>If you are using an ILS approach, you can also change the
ND to an ILS rose. Right click in the ND and select Mode-&gt;ILS Rose.
This will function the same way as any ILS indicator.</li>





      <li>The PFD will also show ILS progress if the <a href="MFCURef.htm#FCUND">ILS button on the MFCU</a> is engaged.</li>



  <li>Happy landing!</li>
