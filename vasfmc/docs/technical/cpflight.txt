 CPFLIGHT vasFMC Integration Manual - (c) by Alex Wemmer <alex@wemmer.at>

=========================================================================

vasFMC 2.x comes with direct support for CPFlight. To enable the CPFlight
interface, go the MENU->SETTINGS page in the MCDU and switch on the
CPFlight module. vasFMC will try open a connection to serial port COM1
and to startup the CPFlight MCP. If you have a standard setup with the
MCP at COM1 you can use the MCP with vasFMC right away.

If you use another COM port or want to configure the MCP commands,
quit vasFMC (also quit the flightsimulator when using the gauge version
of vasFMC) and go to the "cfg" directory of the vasFMC installation, 
you will find a cpflight.cfg file there.

This file follows the vasFMC "key=value" format and supports the following
configuration entries:

  Key               Possible Values
  ---               ---------------
  port              The serial port the CPFlight MCP is connected to.
                    COM1, COM2, etc.

  vor1              Mapping of the VOR1 input, possible values:
                    vor_left, vor_right, 
                    qnh_left, qnh_right,
                    mapmode_left, mapmode_right, 
                    maprange_left, maprange_right

  vor2              Mapping of the VOR2 input, possible values:
                    vor_left, vor_right,
                    qnh_left, qnh_right,
                    mapmode_left, mapmode_right, 
                    maprange_left, maprange_right

Besides the keys listed above, the MCP keycodes as specified in the 
CPFlight documentation (e.g. the code K025 stands for MCP HDG SEL) can
be assigned to vasFMC functions as specified in the fsuipcs.offset.txt
document, which is also located in the vasFMC "doc" directory.

For example, if you want to assign the MCP key code "K025" to the 
vasFMC FCU control "set HDG lock + bug", which would be FSUIPC offset 
0x6dd5 with a value of +3 (as specified in the fsuipc.offset.txt doc),
you can add the following line to the vasFMC cpflight.cfg file:

K025=FCU:3

That line means, that the value 3 will be written to the vasFMC FCU 
FSUIPC offset whenever the HDG button on the CPFlight MCP is pressed.

The following vasFMC FSUIPC offset names are supported by the 
vasFMC CPFlight module:

ND_LEFT         equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd0
PFD_LEFT        equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd1
CDU_LEFT        equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd2
FMC             equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd3
ECAM            equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd4
FCU             equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd5
ND_RIGHT        equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd6
PDF_RIGHT       equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd7
CDU_RIGHT       equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd8

Another example: If you want the MCP key code "K034", which stands 
for "MCP CWS A", to toggle the metric altitude display of the 
left vasFMC PFD, add the following line to the cpflight.cfg file:

K034=PFD_LEFT:74

The value 74 is derived from the fsuipc.offset.txt document.

Attention: Make sure, that each key code only occurs once in the file!
