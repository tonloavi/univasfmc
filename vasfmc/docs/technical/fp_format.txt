     FP FORMAT README for vasFMC  - (c) by Alex Wemmer <alex@wemmer.at>

=======================================================================

This README contains a description of the vasFMC 2.x flightplan format.

ATTENTION: As vasFMC is currently alpha software, this format may change!

Overal format
-------------
Flightplans are stored as ASCII text files with the extension ".fmc".
The filename of a flightplan shall be constructed by the ICAO IDs of
the departure and arrival airports and a number with 3 digits.
Example: LOWGLOWW001.fmc

One Waypoint per Line
---------------------
Each line represents one waypoint, the waypoint data are separated by 
pipe characters "|". 

The format of each line is:
   ID|LAT|LON|SPD&ALT RESTRICTION|PARENT|FLAG|ACTIVERWY|OTHER

The ID, LAT and LON fields are mandatory, all other fields are optional.
Optional fields may be empty and must be specified like in the following
example, where the 4th field is empty: ID|LAT|LON||XYZ
   
Field: ID
---------
Contains the waypoint ICAO ID.
Example: LOWG
If the ID starts or ends with an asterisk character (e.g. *GRZ or GRZ*),
the waypoint is treated as an overfly waypoint.

Fields: LAT|LON
-------------------
Contain the latitude and longitude values of the waypoint.
Example: 46.9930560000|15.4391670000

Field: SPD&ALT RESTRICTION
--------------------------
Contains speed and/or altitude restrictions. The speed value (knots) and the 
altitude value (feet) are separated by a slash character.

Examples:
	Speed only restriction:			250/
	Altitude only restriction:		12000
	Speed and altitude restriction:	250/12000

Field: PARENT
-------------
Contains the parent of the waypoint, e.g. an airway, SID or STAR.
Example: MILGO1G

Field: FLAG
-----------
Contains information about special waypoints.
Possible values: ADEP,SID,T/C,E/D,T/D,STAR,TRANS,ADES,MISSED,DCT,DISC
Only one flag value may be set for each waypoint!

Field: ACTIVERWY
----------------
If the waypoint is an airport (ADEP or ADES flag set), this field
may contain the active runway to be used for that airport.
Example: 17C

Field: OTHER
------------
This item may only be set for the first waypoint of the flightplan!
Contains further flightplan related items which are separated by 
semicolons. Each item has a "key=value" format.

The possible keys area:
  	cfl		    cruise flightlevel
  	ctemp		OAT at cruise flightlevel in degree centigrade
	croute		company route name (FP filename)
	fnr			flight number (callsign)
	cindex		cost index
	tropo		tropopause in feet
	actwpt		index of the currenty active waypoint
	adep		ICAO ID of the departure airport
	ades		ICAO ID of the destination airport
    accel_alt   acceleration altitude
    thrust_red_alt thrust reduction altitude
	
Example: 

cfl=110;ctemp=-15;croute=LOWGLOWW001;fnr=AUA2FG;cindex=20;tropo=36092;actwpt=0
