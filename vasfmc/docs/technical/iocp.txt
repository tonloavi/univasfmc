=========================================================================

vasFMC 2.x comes with direct support for the opencockpit.com IOCP 
protocol. The enable the IOCP server, go the MENU->SETTINGS page in the 
MCDU and switch on the IOCP server. vasFMC will open the IOCP TCP server
on port 8092 and is ready to receive IOCP commands. If you want vasFMC
to listen to another port, you can change this in the iocp.cfg 
configuration file located in the "cfg" directory of vasFMC.

Furthermore, the IOCP command to vasFMC action assignment is fully 
configurable via the iocp.cfg configuration file. The file follows the 
vasFMC "key=value" format and supports the following configuration entries:

  Key               Possible Values
  ---               ---------------
  tcp_por           The TCP/IP port the vasFMC IOCPC server listens to.

Besides the keys listed above, IOCP commands can be assigned to vasFMC 
actions as specified in the fsuipcs.offset.txt document, 
which is also located in the vasFMC "doc" directory.

For example, if you want to assign the IOCP key 5 with value 17 to the 
vasFMC action "display the F-PLAN page on the left CDU", which would 
be FSUIPC offset 0x6dd2 with a value of +67 (as specified in the 
fsuipc.offset.txt doc), you can add the following line to the vasFMC 
iocp.cfg file:

5_17=CDU_LEFT:67

That line means, that the value 67 will be written to the vasFMC left CDU 
FSUIPC offset whenever this IOCP command is received.

The following vasFMC FSUIPC offset names are supported by the 
vasFMC IOCP module:

ND_LEFT         equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd0
PFD_LEFT        equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd1
CDU_LEFT        equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd2
FMC             equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd3
ECAM            equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd4
FCU             equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd5
ND_RIGHT        equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd6
PDF_RIGHT       equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd7
CDU_RIGHT       equals the vasFMC FSUIPC offset 0x6dd8

Attention: Make sure, that each "key_value" code only occurs once in the file!

Unkown IOCP commands received by vasFMC are logged to the vasFMC
logfile. These outputs can be used to adapt the vasFMC IOCP configuration
to your setup.
